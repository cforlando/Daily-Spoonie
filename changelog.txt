Login input boxes have login functionality attached to Enter keypress (both username and password)

Login input boxes are now tied to Vuelidate and will reactively update as they're being typed
into. The login button will not contact the Firebase server until the username/password meet
the minimum criteria (valid email/email length >0 and password length > 0)

Login now redirects to main page and changes the login button to a logout button. The ability to
sign out has also been implemented. Remaining issue is that the change in user authentication
does not get reflected on the main page after logging out. Firebase has a function 
`onAuthStateChanged` that could be useful, will try next.

Fixed login/logout, but ran into issue with Firebase and Vuex.

Fixed Firebase/Vuex issue (correctly [as far as I know] utilized Vuex's dispatch/commit
paradigm). Also corrected style issue of imports having code between them in App.vue, and moved
the imports and set up calls into main.js. Login/Logout is now working, but login is not
persistent on refresh. I suspect this is because the store gets reset upon refresh, and the
state is set to null by default. Need to find a way to correctly set the store's value directly
from Firebase upon reset.
